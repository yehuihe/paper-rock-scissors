<h1>Paper Rock Scissors</h1>

<p>I used python 3.6 for the assignment</p>

<p>A standard paper-rock-scissors game. I implemented the game
using python's default RNG. I only used the standard library for
the assignment as I do not think other library will have
significant contribution. Unittest is done by unittest as it's my
most familiar one.</p>

<p>I believe I make the instruction fairly clearly in the console.</p>
<p><b>main.py</b> is the main program to run.</p>
<p><b>python main.py -h</b> will show cli and arguments</p>
<p>For example: 
<b>python main.py -t 10 -m 15 -pn Yehui -cn IMC -s 0</b></p>
<p>will set appropriate attributes for the match. Or use default values</p>

<p>The console output of unit testing is a bit lengthy. I intented to implement
verbose option but couldn't spend more time on this assignment due to other commitments.
I intended to write more unittests later.</p>

<p>Thank you for your time. I'm looking forward to hear your feedback.</p>
